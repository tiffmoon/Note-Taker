THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```

## Instructions

The user clicks the 'Get Started' button on the landing page that redirects to the notes page.

The user can perform 3 different functions on this page:

* Create a new note - the 'save' button does not appear unless something is entered for both the 'title' and 'text' of the note.

* Delete existing notes - clicking the bin icon on the right of the note permenantly deletes the note from the json file.

* Display existing notes from the notes bar - clicking on the notes will display the selected note.
